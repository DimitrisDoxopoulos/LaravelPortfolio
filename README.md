# LaravelPortfolio
A porfolio website made in Laravel 9. Guide made by The CodeHolic

This is a project that I am following to understand Laravel 9 better and also use the website as
a portfolio.

[The Codeholic](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_UMEcP_kF0z4E6KbxCpV1w) has been a great help on
my journey on PHP, Yii2 and Laravel, so many thanks :D
